# Simple Travel Booking System with MySQL and PHP

Welcome to my first repository! I made this project for a Server Side Programming/Web Design course in my third year of college using XAMPP. This project is written mainly in vanilla languages, without the use of any framework. For the back-end functionality I used PHP connecting to a MySQL database, hosted on an Apache web server. For the front-end functionality I used Javascript along with HTML and CSS. Unfortunately the SQL file was not saved during the time of making this project. The image resources were gathered from the Internet, along with a few edits using Adobe Photoshop.

Languages Used within this Project:
* HTML
* PHP
* SQL
* CSS
* JavaScript 

The login/register function was made using the tutorial at:
