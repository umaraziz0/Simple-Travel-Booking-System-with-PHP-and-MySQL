# Simple Travel Booking System with MySQL and PHP

Welcome to my first repository! I made this project for a Server Side Programming/Web Design course in my third year of college using XAMPP. This project is written mainly in base PHP along connecting to a MySQL database for the back-end functionality. Unfortunately the SQL file was not saved during the time of making this project. For the front-end functionality I used basic Javascript along with HTMl and CSS. Some images resources were taken straight from the Internet and a few I edited using Photoshop.

Languages Used within this Project:
* HTML
* PHP
* SQL
* CSS
* JavaScript (a little bit)

The login/register function was made using the tutorial at:
