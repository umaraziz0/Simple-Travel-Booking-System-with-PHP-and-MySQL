# Simple Travel Booking System with MySQL and PHP

Welcome to my first repository! I made this project for a Server Side Programming course in my third year of college. 
This was before I started using Git and GitHub to keep track of my progress throughout the project so there wasn't any changelogs. 

The login/register function was made using the tutorial at:

Some images I got straight from the internet and a few I edited using Photoshop.

Thanks for visiting!
