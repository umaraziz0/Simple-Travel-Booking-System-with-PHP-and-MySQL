# Simple Travel Booking System with MySQL and PHP

Welcome to my first repository! I made this project for a Server Side Programming course in my third year of college using XAMPP. 
Unfortunately I didn't save the SQL file for the database at that time. Also this project was made before I started using Git and GitHub to keep track of my progress throughout the project so there wasn't any changelogs. 

Languages Used within this Project:
1. HTML
2. PHP
3. SQL
4. CSS
5. JavaScript (a little bit)

The login/register function was made using the tutorial at:

Some images I got straight from the internet and a few I edited using Photoshop.

Thanks for visiting!
